    <h1>Simple article</h1>
    <p>An <i>indefinite</i> article indicates that its noun is not a particular one (or ones) identifiable to the listener. It may be something that the speaker is mentioning for the first time, or its precise identity may be irrelevant or hypothetical, or the speaker may be making a general statement about any such thing. English uses <i>a/an</i>, from the Old English forms of the number "one", as its primary indefinite article. The form <i>an</i> is used before words that begin with a vowel sound (even if spelled with an initial consonant, as in <i>an hour</i>), and <i>a</i> before words that begin with a consonant sound (even if spelled with a vowel, as in <i>a European</i>).</p>

    <p>Before some words beginning with a pronounced (not silent) <i>h</i> in an unstressed first syllable, such as <i>historic(al)</i>, <i>hallucination</i>, <i>hilarious</i>, <i>horrendous</i>, and <i>horrific</i>, some (especially older) British writers prefer to use <i>an</i> over <i>a</i> (<i>an historical event</i>, etc.).<sup id="cite_ref-New_Oxford_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-New_Oxford-7">[7]</a></sup> <i>An</i> is also preferred before <i>hotel</i> by some writers of British English (probably reflecting the relatively recent adoption of the word from French, in which the <i>h</i> is not pronounced).<sup id="cite_ref-Peterspg1_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Peterspg1-8">[8]</a></sup> The use of "an" before words beginning with an unstressed "h" is more common generally in British English than in American.<sup id="cite_ref-Peterspg1_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Peterspg1-8">[8]</a></sup> American writers normally use <i>a</i> in all these cases, although there are occasional uses of <i>an historic(al)</i> in American English.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> According to the New Oxford Dictionary of English, such use is increasingly rare in British English too.<sup id="cite_ref-New_Oxford_7-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-New_Oxford-7">[7]</a></sup> Unlike British English, American English typically uses <i>an</i> before <i>herb</i>, since the <i>h</i> in this word is silent for most Americans. The correct usage in respect of the term "hereditary peer" was the subject of an amendment debated in the UK Parliament.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup></p>

    <p>Using <i>a</i> before a word beginning with a vowel sound in unstressed syllables - such as <i>I left a orange on the working surface.</i> - is not uncommon, but is universally considered non-standard.</p>
